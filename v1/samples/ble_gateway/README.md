# Azure IoT Edge - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sample

This sample uses Azure IoT Edge to build a gateway that forwards telemetry from a BLE device to IoT Hub, and forwards commands from IoT Hub to the BLE device. The associated [tutorial](./iot-hub-iot-edge-physical-device.md) provides a detailed walkthrough of the [BLE Gateway sample code](src/main.c) and JSON configuration file to illustrate the fundamental components of the Azure IoT Edge architecture:
