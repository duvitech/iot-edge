## Enable the connection between the IoT gateway and the SensorTag

In this section, you perform the following tasks:

- Get the MAC address of the SensorTag for Bluetooth connection.
- Initiate a Bluetooth connection from the IoT gateway to the SensorTag.

### Get the MAC address of the SensorTag for Bluetooth connection

1. On the host computer, run the SSH client and connect to the IoT gateway.
1. Unblock Bluetooth by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
   ```

1. Start the Bluetooth service on the IoT gateway and enter a Bluetooth shell to configure Bluetooth by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start bluetooth
   bluetoothctl
   ```

1. Power on the Bluetooth controller by running the following command at the Bluetooth shell:

   ```bash
   power on
   ```

   ![power on the Bluetooth controller on the IoT gateway with bluetoothctl](./../media/iot-hub-iot-gateway-connect-device-to-cloud/8_power-on-bluetooth-controller-at-bluetooth-shell-bluetoothctl.png)

1. Start scanning for nearby Bluetooth devices by running the following command:

   ```bash
   scan on
   ```

   ![Scan nearby Bluetooth devices with bluetoothctl](./../media/iot-hub-iot-gateway-connect-device-to-cloud/9_start-scan-nearby-bluetooth-devices-at-bluetooth-shell-bluetoothctl.png)

1. Press the pairing button on the SensorTag. The green LED on the SensorTag flashes.
1. At the Bluetooth shell, you should see the SensorTag is found. Make a note of the MAC address of the SensorTag. In this example, the MAC address of the SensorTag is `24:71:89:C0:7F:82`.
1. Turn off the scan by running the following command:

   ```bash
   scan off
   ```

   ![Stop scanning nearby Bluetooth devices with bluetoothctl](./../media/iot-hub-iot-gateway-connect-device-to-cloud/10_stop-scanning-nearby-bluetooth-devices-at-bluetooth-shell-bluetoothctl.png)

### Initiate a Bluetooth connection from the IoT gateway to the SensorTag

1. Connect to the SensorTag by running the following command:

   ```bash
   connect <MAC address>
   ```

   ![Connect to the SensorTag with bluetoothctl](./../media/iot-hub-iot-gateway-connect-device-to-cloud/11_connect-to-sensortag-at-bluetooth-shell-bluetoothctl.png)

1. Disconnect from the SensorTag and exit the Bluetooth shell by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   disconnect
   exit
   ```

   ![Disconnect from the SensorTag with bluetoothctl](./../media/iot-hub-iot-gateway-connect-device-to-cloud/12_disconnect-from-sensortag-at-bluetooth-shell-bluetoothctl.png)

You've successfully enabled the connection between the SensorTag and the IoT gateway.

## Run a BLE sample application to send SensorTag data to your IoT hub

The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sample application is provided by Azure IoT Edge. The sample application collects data from BLE connection and send the data to you IoT hub. To run the sample application, you need to:

1. Configure the sample application.
1. Run the sample application on the IoT gateway.

### Configure the sample application

1. Go to the folder of the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/azureiotgatewaysdk/samples/ble_gateway
   ```

1. Open the configuration file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   vi ble_gateway.json
   ```

1. In the configuration file, fill in the following values:

   **IoTHubName**: The name of your IoT hub.

   **IoTHubSuffix**: Get IoTHubSuffix from the primary key of the device connection string that you noted down. Ensure that you get the primary key of the device connection string, not the primary key of your IoT hub connection string. The primary key of the device connection string is in the format of `HostName=IOTHUBNAME.IOTHUBSUFFIX;DeviceId=DEVICEID;SharedAccessKey=SHAREDACCESSKEY`.

   **Transport**: The default value is `amqp`. This value shows the protocol during transpotation. It could be `http`, `amqp`, or `mqtt`.

   **macAddress**: The MAC address of the SensorTag that you noted down.

   **deviceID**: ID of the device that you created in your IoT hub.

   **deviceKey**: The primary key of the device connection string.

   ![Complete the config file of the BLE sample application](./../media/iot-hub-iot-gateway-connect-device-to-cloud/13_edit-config-file-of-ble-sample.png)

1. Press `ESC` and type `:wq` to save the file.

### Run the sample application

1. Make sure the SensorTag is powered on.
1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   ./ble_gateway ble_gateway.json
   ```
